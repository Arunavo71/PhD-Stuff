+ In the context of LTL, a property $P$ is deemed "safe" iff  at any stage we get stuck in a loop and we have access to the history, it is safe to infer $P$. 
+ This is a "conservative" notion: minimal things we can say given updates.  
+ What can be safe explanations can be thought of "minimal" robust explanations.
